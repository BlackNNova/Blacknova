Investigation Notes:

1. Writer Creation Issue:
- Error message "Error creating writer account" is in main.py line 715
- Error occurs in exception block that rolls back session
- Nested try-except blocks in create_writer():
  * Outer block: Writer creation and DB commit
  * Inner block: Email sending
- Development vs Production handling:
  * Development: Shows credentials in logs
  * Production: Rolls back on email error
- Potential Issues:
  * Email error triggers unnecessary rollback
  * Success/error state inconsistent with DB state
  * Flash messages might be duplicated

2. Navigation Structure:
- Base template hierarchy:
  * base.html (root template with flash messages)
  * admin/base.html (extends base.html, adds admin navigation)
  * specific pages extend admin/base.html
- Template Block Issues:
  * create_order.html extends admin/base.html but uses {% block content %}
  * Should use {% block admin_content %} to preserve navigation
- Navigation Components:
  * Proper navigation bar in admin/base.html
  * Dashboard link exists but might be hidden
  * Template inheritance chain broken by wrong block usage

3. Flash Message Handling:
- Multiple flash message displays:
  * base.html: Uses toastr.js for notifications
  * admin/base.html: Has additional flash message display
- Potential Issues:
  * Double display of messages
  * JavaScript event handlers might duplicate notifications
  * Toastr configuration might need adjustment

4. Email Configuration:
- Development mode:
  * Prints credentials to logs
  * Doesn't rollback on email error
- Production mode:
  * Rolls back transaction on email error
  * Might cause inconsistent state
- Need to verify:
  * Mail server configuration
  * Environment variables
  * Development vs Production settings
